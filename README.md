# 4Geeks data science project boilerplate

[![Codespaces Prebuilds](https://github.com/gperdrizet/4Geeks_datascience_project/actions/workflows/codespaces/create_codespaces_prebuilds/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gperdrizet/4Geeks_datascience_project/actions/workflows/codespaces/create_codespaces_prebuilds)

Minimal Python 3.11 repository for 4Geeks data science assignments. Several useful Python packages and VSCode extensions are installed on Codespace boot-up. Directories for models and data are created within the Codespace but excluded from tracking. The notebooks directory contains `notebook.ipynb`, run this notebook to verify the environment. It can then be deleted or renamed to use for your project.

## 1. Getting started

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the GitHub repository page
   - 4Geeks students: set 4GeeksAcademy as the owner - 4Geeks pays for your codespace usage. All others, set yourself as the owner
   - Give the fork a descriptive name. 4Geeks students: I recommend including your GitHub username to help in finding the fork if you loose the link
   - Click "Create fork"
   - 4Geeks students: bookmark or otherwise save the link to your fork

2. **Create a GitHub Codespace**
   - On your forked repository, click the "Code" button
   - Select "Create codespace on main"
   - If the "Create codespace on main" option is grayed out - go to your codespaces list from the three-bar menu at the upper left and delete an old codespace
   - Wait for the environment to load (dependencies are pre-installed)

3. **Start Working**
   - Open `notebooks/notebook.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface
   - Run the notebook to verify that your environment is working correctly - if there are no errors, you are all set!

### Option 2: Local Development

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Git
   - Python >= 3.10

2. **Fork the repository**
   - Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the GitHub repository page
   - Optional: give the fork a new name and/or description
   - Click "Create fork"

3. **Clone the repository**
   - From your fork of the repository, click the green "Code" button at the upper right
   - From the "Local" tab, select HTTPS and copy the link
   - Run the following commands on your machine, replacing `<LINK>` and `<REPO_NAME>`

   ```bash
   git clone <LINK>
   cd <REPO_NAME>
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Launch Jupyter & start the notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/notebook.ipynb
   ```

   Once the notebook opens in your web browser, run it once to verify that your environment is working correctly - if there are no errors, you are all set!
